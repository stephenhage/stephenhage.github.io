title: About Me
---
As I approach the end of my coursework for my Master of Science in Predictive Analytics, I've started thinking about how I can share some of what I've learned with aspiring practitioners. I've had the good fortune of working on text analysis and computer vision and deep learning for forecasting under the tutelage of experts like Dr. Larry Fulton and Dr. Thomas Miller.

I am hopeful that perhasp some of the tutorials I write will shortcut learning for some, or reinforce understanding for others, or challenge previously-held beliefs based on the data.

Goals
I am interested in many different topics, and I trust that over time that will play out with some innovative and fun analyses. These include:

Sports
Health
Culture
Language
Food
I've also been known to compete at Kaggle from time to time.
